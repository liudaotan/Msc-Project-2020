## COM6513 Natural Language Processing. 
This module provides an introduction to the field of computer processing of written natural language, known as Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will cover standard theories, models and algorithms, discuss competing solutions to problems, describe example systems and applications, and highlight areas of open research.

### Aims
- to give you a well-rounded feel for the problems and approaches of NLP;
- to give you an understanding of the potential areas of application of the techniques developed in NLP.

### Objectives
By the end of this course you should:
- be able to describe and discuss the subareas of NLP;
- be able to implement NLP algorithms and techniques;
- be able to describe and discuss the potential and limitations of NLP techniques for applications such as machine translation, text classification and language modelling.


## COM6012 Scalable Machine Learning
This module will focus on technologies and algorithms that can be applied to data at a very large scale (e.g. population level). From a theoretical perspective it will focus on parallelization of algorithms and algorithmic approaches such as stochastic gradient descent. There will also be a significant practical element to the module that will focus on approaches to deploying scalable ML in practice such as SPARK, programming languages such as Python/Scala and deployment on high performance computing platforms/clusters.

### Aims:
This unit aims to to provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental technologies underlying data analytics at scale. In particular it will provide advanced understanding of 
- parallelization of algorithms and algorithmic approaches such as stochastic gradient descent 
- practical skills relating to the deployment of scalable ML

### Objectives	
By the end of the unit, a student will be able to
- understand the theoretical issues and wider context relating to ML at scale;
- understand practical parallelization of algorithms and algorithmic approaches using such techniques as stochastic gradient descent;
- deploy a practical implementation of ML at scale, using SPARK, and programming languages such as Python/Scala;
- deployment onto high performance computing platforms/clusters.
