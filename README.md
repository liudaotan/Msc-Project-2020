## COM6513 Natural Language Processing. 
This module provides an introduction to the field of computer processing of written natural language, known as Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will cover standard theories, models and algorithms, discuss competing solutions to problems, describe example systems and applications, and highlight areas of open research.

Aims
- to give you a well-rounded feel for the problems and approaches of NLP;
- to give you an understanding of the potential areas of application of the techniques developed in NLP.

Objectives
By the end of this course you should:
- be able to describe and discuss the subareas of NLP;
- be able to implement NLP algorithms and techniques;
- be able to describe and discuss the potential and limitations of NLP techniques for applications such as machine translation, text classification and language modelling.
